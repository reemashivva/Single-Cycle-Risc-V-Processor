Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor
A Verilog-based implementation of a single-cycle RISC-V processor that executes RV32I instructions in one clock cycle. This project is designed for educational and experimental purposes, demonstrating the fundamentals of processor design and the RISC-V ISA.
Features

RV32I ISA Support ‚Äì Implements core integer instructions (arithmetic, logical, load/store, branch, jump).

Single-Cycle Datapath ‚Äì Each instruction completes in a single clock cycle.

Harvard Architecture ‚Äì Separate instruction and data memories.

Modular Design ‚Äì Cleanly separated modules for Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback.

Parameterizable Components ‚Äì Easy to modify data width or memory size.

This project implements a Single-Cycle RISC-V Processor that supports the RV32I base instruction set. The processor is designed using Verilog HDL and follows a Harvard architecture, with separate instruction and data memories.

In a single-cycle design, each instruction is fetched, decoded, executed, and written back within one clock cycle. This makes the design simple and easy to understand but results in a longer clock period since the cycle time must accommodate the slowest instruction (e.g., load).

üîß Key Features

RV32I Instruction Set ‚Äì Implements arithmetic, logical, load/store, branch, and jump instructions.

Single-Cycle Datapath ‚Äì No pipelining; CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) = 1 for all instructions.

Modular Design ‚Äì Separated into Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Writeback stages.

Control Logic ‚Äì Centralized control unit generates control signals based on instruction opcode.

Parameterizable Memory ‚Äì Instruction and data memory sizes can be easily modified.

üìê Architecture Overview

Fetch: Program Counter (PC) selects instruction from Instruction Memory.

Decode: Control unit decodes instruction; register file outputs source operands.

Execute: ALU performs arithmetic/logical operation; branch/jump decision made.

Memory: Data memory accessed for loads and stores.

Writeback: Result written back to register file (ALU result, memory data, or PC+4).

- Add pipelining for better performance

- Support for RV32M (Multiply/Divide) instructions

- Support for exceptions & interrupts
